# User Stories

## Home page (*authentication*):

Movie Hub is an app which allows users to add the movie title along with release year and story details once *registered and logged in*.

Register link will take the user to the page where they can input required name(*5 characters or more*), email and password(*5 characters or more*). 

Once user registered and logged in they will remain logged in for 7 days.

## Adding a movie title:

Add New Title allows user to add a movie title to our database. 

## Movie index page:

Once title is entered, API feed is fetched and scanned for a title match to import movie image, details and release year.

At this point new movie will be displayed on index page, then user can edit and delete movie information as Title, Details and the year.

## Home page (*authentication*):

User is also able to add any comments to each movie once added, and those comments are automaticly removed once movie is deleted.
